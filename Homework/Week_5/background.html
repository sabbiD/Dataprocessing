		    	The fastly changing technology in the past decades has made it really important to protect your ideas. More and more people have seen the importance of patenting. However, patenting might also have negative effects. Looking at the visualisations it is clear that residents in wealthier countries do apply for more patents. Considering that these countries have a higher income and thus more to spend on research and that this research also contributes to a higher income, lower income countries that are not involved in patents seem to fall even more behind. Especially low income countries that also have a need for drugs face these high prices that pharmaceutical companies give their products, made possible through patenting and prohibiting competition. These effects of patents have become more evident, raising questions about the current procedures behind patenting. 
		  	    It is still important to be able to incentivize people, companies, researchers etc. to keep developing but the negative implications of patenting should also be considered in the regulations.

		  	    Like with a lot of things, Stephen Hawking was on to something. Even though no one has patented the universe yet (to my knowledge), a pharmaceutical company did try to patent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/us/supreme-court-rules-human-genes-may-not-be-patented.html">DNA</a>. So in a few years it might get really costly to live on earth.
